        <p> 'Before I wake' is a horror movie about a child who's dreams come true and manifest themself in real life. However what starts as colorful butterflies from pretty dreams morphs into a terrifying creature when his nightmares turn real. Moving from foster home to foster home, Cody's foster parents continue to be taken by this creature, until he lives with Jessie and Mark Hobson, who try to help him and survive throughout the rest of the movie. I love this movie for it's heavy symbolism and well-done CGI. The plot is amazing and the twist at the end is even better, making it my favorite movie to watch.</p>
